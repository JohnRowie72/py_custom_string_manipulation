# define a function that swaps the case of each character in a string
    # initialize an empty string to store the result
    # loop through each character in the input string
        # if the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase
        # if the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase
            # otherwise, leave it unchanged
    # return the result string
# print the result of calling the function with the string "Hello, World!"
